AI-powered pest detection using YOLOv11 for improved crop monitoring.

# Pest Detection using YOLOv11

This project implements a deep learning model based on the YOLOv11 architecture for real-time pest detection in agricultural images. The system is designed to assist farmers and researchers in identifying common pests to protect crops and improve yield.

## 📌 Features

- 🐛 Detects multiple types of pests with bounding boxes
- ⚡ Real-time inference using YOLOv11
- 📦 Pretrained weights and custom dataset included
- 📊 Performance evaluation with mAP, precision, and recall
- 🖼️ Visualization of results with bounding boxes and class labels

## 🧠 Model

YOLOv11 is a cutting-edge object detection model known for its speed and accuracy. This implementation is fine-tuned for pest detection using a custom-labeled dataset.

## 🗂️ Dataset

This project uses the **[Pest Detection and Identification 2 Computer Vision Project](https://universe.roboflow.com/major-pro/pest-detection-and-identification-2)** provided by Roboflow. The dataset includes annotated images of various pests commonly found in crops. Labels are formatted in YOLO format (`.txt` files for each image).
